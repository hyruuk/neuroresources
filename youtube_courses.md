# Youtube is a great place to learn

Here is a page where you can find vulgarized Youtube resources to learn about concepts useful to (neuro)science.

I think it is good to listen to structured thought even when we don't really understand what's going on. Especially if you're trying to learn about science, you'll end up more often than not hearing about complex, precise and specialized stuff and that can be overwhelming. Do not let that discourage you. Listen to the music of it. You might not understand something now, but still remember it for that later time where it will come handy to understand something else. In the meantime, let's feed you a bit of vocabulary and ideas to start with : 

## Maths
I swear it's less scary that it looks.

### Fourier transform / Transformée de Fourier
Maybe you heard about "decomposing" signals into sums of sines and cosines. But what does that really mean ? Well, maybe it would be more intuitive to start by drawing an elephant, in order to broadly grasp what "drawing with sines" (a.k.a. "transforming in a sum of sines") is about.
