# Welcome to my neuroresources
This is a repo I created during my PhD to store resources that I found useful in learning how to do science and play with brain data. You will find various tools and tips for psychology, data science and neuroscience. This is intended to be useful for any student, whether academic or not, that wants to learn about these topics and I will ultimately try to have your basics covered through this curriculum.

## What I wash I had known starting my PhD :

### In genereal :
- How to ask questions
- Document EVERYTHING (or at least try)

### About computers : 
- Use Git
- No seriously, **use Git**, even poorly
- Automate repetitive stuff, even when it sounds hard
- Test code locally, debugging via SSH is a pain
- Test code on subsets of the data : what works for 1000 epochs should work for 10 epochs (or at least it shouldn't fail)
